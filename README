According to the number of studies available, the spot price in the electricity market has been a very prolific topic in academic research. As pointed out by many of these studies, the prices (the returns or losses) in the electricity market do exhibit some stylized facts, which seems to be in some way similar to these showed by other time series. Some of these facts are seasonality, volatility clustering and asymmetry, extreme events, peaks and fat tails.
Following some talks that I have had with some recruiters, I decided to apply and extend some procedures and statistical methods that I’ve studied and applied during the preparation of my dissertation, back in 2009. The aim of this exercise should be thought as a refreshening and an extension of some skills that I have gained throughout the years. In particular, I’ve decided to apply the Peaks over Threshold procedure to high quantile estimation in a conditional framework, using an ARMA-GJRGARCH asymmetric volatility process to filter the hourly losses of the ‘Prezzo Unico Nazionale’ (PUN), the reference price of the Italian Electricity Market (‘Mercato del Giorno Prima’), in the attempt to estimate some VaR figures that might be able to capture some of the stylized facts that the electricity price returns/losses seem to exhibit.
